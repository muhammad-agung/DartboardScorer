# DartboardScorer

This project took a month to complete due to the lack of resources that I could gather. It introduced me to Arduino, which very daunting for me, but now I love it! P.S., there are many different electronic dartboards out there, so make sure to adjust the Arduino code accordingly, considering variations in the number of slave and master connections.
